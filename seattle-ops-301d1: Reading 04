This article was about the ultimate guide to VPN tunneling and how to use it complete with an associated video on virtual private networks. VPN tunneling is a process that allows data to be securely transported from one device to network to another through the non-secure internet. The data is encrypted and repackaged to help prevent unauthorized use in case of interception through the use of data encryption. 

The metaphor used to describe VPN tunneling is like moving your cash from one back to another in an armoured van. Your cash is the data, the highway is the non-secure internet and the armoured van is the VPN tunnel. 

There are different types of VPN tunneling choices so you have to determine its use such as online streaming, accessing banned websites, cloaking VoIP calls, public WiFI use, P2P file sharing, combating ISP bandwidth throttling, mixed uses and multitasking including local and remote uses.
