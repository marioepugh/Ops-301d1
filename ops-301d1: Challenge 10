# Description of purpose: Create Python script for conditional statements

# Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.
# Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.
# Create an if statement that includes both elif and else to execute when both if and elif are not met.

# Equals: a == b
a = 7
b = 7

if a == b:
    print ("A is equal to B")
else:
    print ("A is not equal to B")
    
# Not Equals: a != b
a = 808
b = 312

if a!= b:
    print ("A is not equal to B")
else:
    print ("A is equal to B")
    
# Less than: a < b
a = 909
b = 634

if a < b:
    print ("A is less than B")
else:
    print ("A is greater than to B")
    
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
a = 789
b = 799

if b <= a:
    print ("A is less than B")
else:
    print ("A is less than or equal to B")

# Greater than: a > b
a = 879
b = 799

if a > b:
    print ("A is greater than B")

# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
a = 451
b = 456

if a >= b:
    print ("A is greater than or equal to B")
else:
    print ("B is greater than or equal to A")
